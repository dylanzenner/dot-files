## Dot Files

This repo contains useful scripts that I use to set up a new machine for development. 

*kube-setup.sh* - installs golang, kubectl, helm, and kind (kubernetes in docker)
> note: this script only works on macOS silicon. If you want to open a PR to update the script to work with your OS youâ€™re more than welcome to.
> note: a function to install docker desktop will be added soon.
